**Problem**

For this project we decided to take a kaggle challenge "Craft canned beers data
set". With the given data we plan to the answer to the following
questions :

-   What types of beers are most popular in different regions

-   Find if there are correlations between attributes like alcohol
    > content by volume, bitterness, style of beer

-   Find how much the beers are similar to one another

After analysing the data the goal is to make a recommender system that
after the user inputs his favourite beers, outputs a set of beers that
the user also might like.

**Data**

The data is split in two files.

-   beers.csv (List of 2K+ craft canned beers from the US.)

    -   row number

    -   ibu - International bittering units, which describe how bitter a
        > drink is.

    -   abv - The alcoholic content by volume with 0 being no alcohol
        > and 1 being pure alcohol.

    -   id - unique id

    -   name - name of the beer

    -   style - beer style(lager, IPA, ale, etc.)

    -   brewery id - Unique identifier for brewery that produces this
        > beer; can use to join with brewery info.

    -   ounces - Size of beer in ounces.

<!-- -->
